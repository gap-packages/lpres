abstract: |
    The LPRES Package defines new GAP objects to work with L-presented groups, namely groups given by a finite generating set and a possibly-infinite set of relations given as iterates of finitely many seed relations by a finite set of endomorphisms. The package implements nilpotent quotient, Todd-Coxeter and Reidemeister-Schreier algorithms for L-presented groups.
